        <p>
          Hi, I’m <strong>Aniket!</strong> I’m currently pursuing  Master’s in Computer
          Applications (MCA) from Medicaps University and specialize in frontend development. I enjoy
          creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites, crafting
          engaging digital experiences that make a difference. When I’m not
          coding, you’ll find me playing volleyball or football, staying active
          and inspired.
